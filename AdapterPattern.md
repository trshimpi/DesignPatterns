# Adapter Design Pattern (Structural Pattern)

## **Definition**

The **Adapter Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them. It translates one interface into another that the client expects, **enabling interoperability** between different systems or classes.

---

## **Key Components**

1. **Target Interface** â€“ The interface expected by the client.
2. **Adaptee (Existing Class)** â€“ The class with an incompatible interface that needs to be adapted.
3. **Adapter (Bridge Class)** â€“ The class that implements the target interface and internally calls the adapteeâ€™s methods, making them compatible.
4. **Client** â€“ The entity that uses the adapter without knowing about the adaptee.

## **When to Use the Adapter Pattern?**

âœ” When you want to use an existing class but its interface is incompatible with what you need.\
âœ” When you need to integrate third-party libraries into your system without modifying their code.\
âœ” When you want to bridge the gap between new and legacy code.\
âœ” When you need to standardize multiple existing classes with different interfaces.

## **Example in Java**

#### **Scenario:**

We have an **old **``** class** that provides 220V power, but our **client (Mobile Charger) needs 5V**. We create an **adapter (**``**)** to convert the voltage.

```java
// Step 1: Define the Target Interface
interface Voltage5V {
    int get5V();
}

// Step 2: Define the Incompatible Adaptee Class
class Voltage220V {
    public int get220V() {
        return 220;
    }
}

// Step 3: Create the Adapter Class
class VoltageAdapter implements Voltage5V {
    private Voltage220V voltage220V;

    public VoltageAdapter(Voltage220V voltage220V) {
        this.voltage220V = voltage220V;
    }

    @Override
    public int get5V() {
        int volts = voltage220V.get220V();
        return volts / 44; // Convert 220V to 5V
    }
}

// Step 4: Client Code
public class AdapterPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Voltage220V voltage220V = new Voltage220V();
        Voltage5V adapter = new VoltageAdapter(voltage220V);
        
        System.out.println("Converted Voltage: " + adapter.get5V() + "V");
        // Output: Converted Voltage: 5V
    }
}
```

## **Types of Adapter Patterns**

1. **Class Adapter (Using Inheritance)**
   - Adapter **extends** the adaptee class and implements the target interface.
   - Used when multiple inheritance is possible.
2. **Object Adapter (Using Composition)**
   - Adapter **contains** an instance of the adaptee class.
   - Preferred approach in Java as it follows **composition over inheritance**.

---

## **Real-World Examples**

1. **Java I/O Streams (InputStreamReader & OutputStreamWriter)**

   - `InputStreamReader` acts as an adapter between **byte streams** and **character streams**.

2. **JDBC Drivers**

   - JDBC provides a unified API for different databases by using adapters (drivers) to connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

3. **Spring Framework Adapters**

   - `HandlerAdapter` bridges the gap between **different request handlers** in Spring MVC.

4. **Legacy System Integration**

   - Adapting an old logging system to work with a modern logging framework.

---

## **Advantages**

âœ” **Allows Reusability** â€“ Reuse existing code without modification.\
âœ” **Improves Compatibility** â€“ Makes incompatible interfaces work together.\
âœ” **Follows Open/Closed Principle** â€“ The adapter can be extended without modifying existing code.\
âœ” **Enhances Code Maintainability** â€“ Keeps client code simple by using a unified interface.

## **Disadvantages**

âœ˜ **Increased Complexity** â€“ Adds an extra layer between client and adaptee.\
âœ˜ **Overhead** â€“ Adapter processing may introduce slight performance overhead.

The **Adapter Pattern** is widely used in **frameworks, legacy integration, and third-party API adaptation** to ensure different systems can communicate seamlessly! ðŸš€
